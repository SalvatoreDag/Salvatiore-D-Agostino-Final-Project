            The arctic is warming around twice as fast as global average. Some
            of the reasons for this are: The arctic amplification, the albedo
            effect, and black carbon. From 1979 to 1996, we lost 2.2 â€“ 3% of the
            arctic ice cover. From 2010 to present we are losing 12.85% per
            decade! Another consequence is permafrost thawing. This is a process
            in which large amounts of methane is released to the atmosphere,
            fueling more the process of global warming. We lose Arctic sea ice
            at a rate of almost 13% per decade, and over the past 30 years, the
            oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has declined by a stunning
            95%. If emissions continue to rise unchecked, <span className="font-bold underline"> the Arctic could be
            ice-free in the summer by 2040.</span>
